## Triggering a Delivery using the CI

The easiest way to deliver a new build to production or development is to trigger the corresponding CircleCI workflows _triggered_native_development_delivery_ and _triggered_production_delivery_:

- Get a CircleCI [Personal API Token](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/).
- Trigger a delivery by sending a POST request to:`https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/github/digitalfabrik/lunes-app/pipeline`
  - header needs to contain `Circle-Token=your-personal-token` and `content-type=application/json`
  - body could look like this:
    ```json
    {
      "parameters": {
        "run_commit": false,
        "run_dev_delivery": true
      }
    }
    ```
  - If no branch is specified, main is used as default. This should normally not be changed.
  - Per default a development delivery is made.
  - For more information on how to use it, execute it without parameters to see usage information.

An example cURL request to start a dev delivery would be the following:

```
curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/github/digitalfabrik/lunes-app/pipeline \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Circle-Token: <your token>" \
  -d '{
        "branch": "<your branch>",
        "parameters": {
          "run_dev_delivery": true
        }
      }'
```

## Workflows

Several workflows exist for different purposes:

- **commit**: Executed for all commits of PRs to ensure good code quality and working code. Android or iOS apps are not build.
- **commit_main**: Executed for all commits on main. Code is checked and Android and iOS apps are build.
- **dev_delivery**: [Manually triggerable](#triggering-a-delivery-using-the-ci) workflow which delivers builds to development/beta.
- **prod_delivery**: [Manually triggerable](#triggering-a-delivery-using-the-ci) workflow which delivers builds to production.
- **promote**: [Manually triggerable](#triggering-a-delivery-using-the-ci) workflow which promotes latest beta to production.
- **browsertack_delivery**: [Manually triggerable](#triggering-a-delivery-using-the-ci) workflow to build the ios and android app and upload it to browserstack.

## Services

### deliverino (GitHub)

`deliverino` is a GitHub App and can be accessed and installed [here](https://github.com/apps/deliverino). This bot bumps the version of the app when a new release is delivered.
A private key in PEM format grants access to the bot. If the `deliverino` is installed for a specific repository then it has access to create commits there.

**`deliverino` has the role of an Administrator. This is important when setting up [Protected branches](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-branch-restrictions) in GitHub. You have to disable "Include Administrators", else `deliverino` is not allowed to directly commit to the protected branch.**

### Google Play Store

You can visit the management website for the Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/). The Google Play Console is the product by Google for managing the App Store presence.

#### Adding Testers to the Beta Track

The Play Store has the concept of tracks to manage released versions of the app. The beta track is for public tests. Tests can be added via their Google E-Mail or by signing up at [play.google.com/apps/testing/tuerantuer.app.integreat](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/tuerantuer.app.integreat).

### App Store Connect

#### Authenticating

Authentication happens by setting the `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT` environment variable as documented [below](#ios-variables).

### BrowserStack

We are using BrowserStack to run our E2E tests on real iOS and Android devices.

## Fastlane

Fastlane is a task-runner for triggering build relevant tasks. It offers integration with XCode and the Android SDK for building and delivering the app.

### Fastlane Setup

- Make sure ruby is installed and `ruby --version` reports the correct version
- run `bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle` to set the local path
- run `bundle install` in the project root **AND** in `./android/` **AND** in `./ios/`.

### Lanes

To run a lane run `bundle exec fastlane [lane]`

Lanes for Android live in [./android/fastlane](./android/fastlane) and for iOS in [./ios/fastlane](./ios/fastlane)
